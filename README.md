|Personalized Latent Structure Learning for Recommendation|TPAMI 2023|First, introduce a base DAG learning model. \\ Level 1 challenge: personalized DAG. Someone not follow majority, and some hidden variables. Level 2 challenge: sparse and noisy nature of interaction data. PlanRec: latent structure personalization and balancing personalization and shared knowledge for each individual over the base latent structure learning model|
